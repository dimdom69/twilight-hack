Extremely short instructions: put this savegame on your Wii (if you have
one on there already that you want to keep, back it up first!), start the
game, walk to the "art room" (find some walkthrough on the intertubes if
you cannot find it), look at the second character, enjoy!

Kudos to "roto" for finding the original buffer overflow, and many thanks
for doing lots of testing!
